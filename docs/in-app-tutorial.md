# IOTA Identity Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the use of the IOTA Identity Framework to create, share and verify some information about a device in the following sections:

1. Initialize an IOTA Identity client
2. Create identities
3. Create verifiable credentials
4. Create verifiable presentations
5. Verify presentations
6. Putting it all together

For each step, a function is defined that you should be able to reuse in your application(s).

## Before you begin

If you are unfamiliar with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), we recommend reading the overviews of chapters 2, 3.1 and 3.2 of the [IOTA Identity guide](https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/introduction).

The IOTA Identity framework is implemented in Rust. In order to use it in JavaScript, WASM bindings are available from the NPM package `@iota/identity-wasm`. Please refer to [IOTA Identity WASM - Getting Started](https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/libraries/wasm/getting_started) for set up instructions in both NodeJS and web (browser) contexts. This tutorial assumes a web context, but code comments show where usage is not the same as in NodeJS.

To complete the tutorial, you will need the following imports:

```js
import {
    init,
    Client,
    Config,
    Digest,
    Document,
    KeyCollection,
    KeyPair,
    KeyType,
    Network,
    VerifiableCredential,
    VerifiablePresentation,
    VerificationMethod
} from "@iota/identity-wasm/web"; // NOTE: Web context.
```

## Initialize an IOTA Identity Client

We will create a client that connects to the IOTA mainnet through one of the IOTA Foundation's nodes. Data transactions (such as identities) are pruned after some time and so we should also configure a Permanode from which identities can be fetched by the client even after a pruning cycle.

```js
async function createClient() {
    // Configure IOTA Identity client to connect to the IOTA mainnet.
    const cfg = Config.fromNetwork(Network.try_from_name("main"));
    cfg.setNode("https://chrysalis-nodes.iota.org");
    cfg.setPermanode("https://chrysalis-chronicle.iota.org/api/mainnet/");
    
    // Return the client.
    return Client.fromConfig(cfg);
}
```

## Create Identities

Creating an identity involves generating a public-private key pair (`authKeyPair`) that gets used to control access to the DID document on the Tangle. Additionally, a separate key collection is created and added as a verification method for this identity so verifiers may authenticate VCs issued. The `client` parameter can be provided using `createClient` above.

```js
async function createIdentity(client) {
    // Generate a new key pair and DID document for the new identity.
    const authKeyPair = new KeyPair(KeyType.Ed25519);
    const doc = new Document(authKeyPair, client.network().toString());

    // Add a Merkle Key Collection method for the identity, so compromised keys can be revoked.
    const keys = new KeyCollection(KeyType.Ed25519, 8);
    const method = VerificationMethod.createMerkleKey(Digest.Sha256, doc.id, keys, "key-collection");

    // Add to the DID Document as a general-purpose verification method.
    doc.insertMethod(method, "VerificationMethod");

    // Sign the DID document with the auth key. Ensure only the private key holder can manipulate this document.
    doc.sign(authKeyPair);

    // Publish the document to the Tangle.
    await client.publishDocument(doc);

    // Return the new identity data.
    return { authKeyPair, doc, keys, method };
}
```

## Create Verifiable Credentials

A Verifiable Credential consists of some "claims" about a "subject" (DID) that have been attested by an "issuer" (DID). In the case of a self-signed credential, the issuer is also the subject of the credential. The function below takes a claims object and identities (created using `createIdentity`) to produce a signed (verifiable) credential.

```js
async function createVerifiableCredential(claims, issuer, subject) {
    // Create an unsigned credential.
    const unsignedVc = VerifiableCredential.extend({
        id: `http://example.org/zebra-iota-sdk/1234`,
        type: "DeviceID",
        issuer: issuer.doc.id.toString(),
        credentialSubject: {
            id: subject.doc.id.toString(),
            ...claims
        }
    });

    // Sign the credential with issuer's Merkle Key Collection method.
    const signedVc = issuer.doc.signCredential(unsignedVc, {
        method: issuer.method.id.toString(),
        public: issuer.keys.public(0),
        private: issuer.keys.private(0),
        proof: issuer.keys.merkleProof(Digest.Sha256, 0)
    });

    // Return the signed VC.
    return signedVc;
}
```

## Create Verifiable Presentations

A Verifiable Presentation is a container for VCs and may be signed by the holder to prove authorship. This function will sign a presentation containing a single VC, however It's possible for multiple VCs, VCs from different issuers or VCs about different subjects to be encapsulated in a VP. The `vc` and `holder` parameters are the outputs of `createVerifiableCredential` and `createIdentity` respectively.

```js
async function createVerifiablePresentation(vc, holder) {
    // Create an unsigned presentation from the credential.
    const unsignedVp = new VerifiablePresentation(holder.doc, vc);

    // Sign the presentation with issuer's Merkle Key Collection method.
    const signedVp = holder.doc.signPresentation(unsignedVp, {
        method: holder.method.id.toString(),
        public: holder.keys.public(0),
        private: holder.keys.private(0),
        proof: holder.keys.merkleProof(Digest.Sha256, 0)
    });

    // Return the signed VP.
    return signedVp;
}
```

The returned VP can be serialized to string for sharing in the form of, for example, a DataMatrix.

## Verify Verifiable Presentations

The recipient of a VP will want to authenticate the DIDs of the VP holder, VC subject(s) and VC issuer(s). A valid presentation attests that all identities and claims made are authentic and original, however it's still the verifier's responsibility to maintain a list of holders, issuers and/or subjects that they recognize and/or trust. The function below takes a `vpString` and `client` from previous sections to produces the verification result.

```js
async function verifyVerifiablePresentation(vpString, client) {
    // Validate the presentation proof and all relevant DID documents.
    const result = await client.checkPresentation(vpString);

    // Return the result.
    return result;
}
```

## Putting it all together

So far we have only defined functions, time to put them to use. The following function will create a client and two identities - one for a device and one for the manufacturer of the device. Some claims about the device are issued as a VC by the manufacturer before encapsulating in a VP ready for sharing. A recipient (e.g. a customer) checks the VP and, if invalid, an error is thrown.

```js
async function run() {
    // Ensure the WASM library is initialized. The library is cached after first initialization.
    // NOTE: Web context.
    await init("/path/to/identity_wasm_bg.wasm");

    const client = await createClient();
    const device = await createIdentity(client);
    const manufacturer = await createIdentity(client);

    // Make up some information about the device.
    const claims = {
        uuid: "d8c9934a-1d6a-4c92-ad6b-5bd2f255dc42",
        name: "Zebra TC21",
        platform: "Android",
        manufacturer: "Zebra Technologies"
    };

    // Turn this information into a Verifiable Credential.
    const vc = await createVerifiableCredential(claims, manufacturer, device);

    // Share the Verifiable Credential through a Verifiable Presentation.
    const vp = await createVerifiablePresentation(vc, manufacturer);

    // The VP can be serialized to JSON for sharing (e.g. encoded as a DataMatrix).
    const vpString = JSON.stringify(vp.toJSON());

    // The recipient of the VP can verify that the presentation (and contained credentials) are valid.
    const {
        verified: vpIsValid,
        credentials: vcVerificationResults
    } = await verifyVerifiablePresentation(vpString, client);

    if (!vpIsValid) {
        throw new Error("The Verifiable Presentation is invalid.");
    }
    
    // The recipient can now trust that the credentials contained in the VP are about the
    // above device and have been issued by the above manufacturer.
    for (const vcResult of vcVerificationResults) {
        console.log(vcResult.credential.credentialSubject);
    }
}

// Run the tutorial
run()
    .then(() => console.log("Complete!"))
    .catch(() => console.error(err));
```
